## Large language model

*Paper of using Large language model (LLM) for polymer.*

- [Unified Multimodal Multidomain Polymer Representation for Property Prediction](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5795287/v1) - A paper of using LLM with Unified Multimodal Multidomain for polymer property prediction.


## Inverse design

## Polymer dataset

- [Polyinfo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6076416) - A Japanese website collecting diverse experimental data for polymers from academic papers. PoLyInfo collects information on polymer names, chemical structures, processing methods of samples, measurement conditions, properties, used monomers and polymerization methods.

## Polymer representation

### Fingerprints
- ECFP ([Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci100050t)) - Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) is a class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. Their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results.

### PSMILES
### BigSMILES
### GNN
- [A graph representation of molecular ensembles for polymer property prediction](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D2SC02839E) - The authors expand molecular graph representations by incorporating “stochastic” edges to describe the average structure of the repeating unit. In effect, these stochastic edges are bonds weighted by their probability of occurring in the polymer chain. This representation can capture (i) the recurrent nature of polymers' repeating units, (ii) the different topologies and isomerisms of polymer chains, and (iii) their varying monomer composition and stoichiometry.
- [Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00875) - Representing the polymer as a circular graph by linking the head and the tail of the monomer repeating unit.
### 3D geometry
- [Uni-mol]

### LLM
- [TransPolymer](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-023-01016-5) - A large language model based on RoBERTa architecture for polymer representation and property prediction.
- [PolyBERT](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39868-6) - A large language model based on DeBERTa architecture for polymer representation and multi-task property prediction.
