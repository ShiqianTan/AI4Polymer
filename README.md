## Polymer representation

### Fingerprints or descriptors
- ECFP ([Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci100050t)) - Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) is a class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. Their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results.
- [Featurization strategies for polymer sequence or composition design by machine learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D1ME00160D) [2022]
- Mordred ([Mordred: a molecular descriptor calculator](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-018-0258-y)) [2018] - Mordred is an open-source tool capable of calculating constitutional descriptors (e.g., molecular weight and atom counts), topological descriptors (information about molecular connectivity and branching), geometrical descriptors (three-dimensional shape and size parameters), electronic descriptors (properties related to electron distribution within the molecule), and physicochemical descriptors (such as solubility parameters and polar surface area).

### GNN
- [A graph representation of molecular ensembles for polymer property prediction](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D2SC02839E) - The authors expand molecular graph representations by incorporating “stochastic” edges to describe the average structure of the repeating unit. In effect, these stochastic edges are bonds weighted by their probability of occurring in the polymer chain. This representation can capture (i) the recurrent nature of polymers' repeating units, (ii) the different topologies and isomerisms of polymer chains, and (iii) their varying monomer composition and stoichiometry.
- [Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00875) - Representing the polymer as a circular graph by linking the head and the tail of the monomer repeating unit.
