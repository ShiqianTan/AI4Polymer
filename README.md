## Polymer representation

### Fingerprints or descriptors
- ECFP ([Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci100050t)) - Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) is a class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. Their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results.
- [Featurization strategies for polymer sequence or composition design by machine learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D1ME00160D) [2022]

- [A graph representation of molecular ensembles for polymer property prediction](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D2SC02839E) - The authors expand molecular graph representations by incorporating “stochastic” edges to describe the average structure of the repeating unit. In effect, these stochastic edges are bonds weighted by their probability of occurring in the polymer chain. This representation can capture (i) the recurrent nature of polymers' repeating units, (ii) the different topologies and isomerisms of polymer chains, and (iii) their varying monomer composition and stoichiometry.
